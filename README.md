# Generating tweets using Machine Learning

This project creates new tweets using all previous tweets made by @realDonaldTrump. Inspired by his charactaristic syntax and abuse of the platform, I wanted to see if my laptop could make tweets that could've been sent by the president himself. 

You can follow the project on Twitter [@MLTrumpTweets](https://twitter.com/MLTrumpTweets)!
